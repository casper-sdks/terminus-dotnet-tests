Feature: Blocks Integration Tests

    Scenario: Evaluate Block Methods

        Given that the latest block is requested via the sdk
        Then request the latest block via the test node
        Then the body of the returned block is equal to the body of the returned test node block
        And the hash of the returned block is equal to the hash of the returned test node block
        And the header of the returned block is equal to the header of the returned test node block
        And the proofs of the returned block are equal to the proofs of the returned test node block
